- 👋 Hi, I’m @AkiraGameDev, a game developer and programmer from Orlando, Florida. 
     I'm also a recent graduate from the University of Central Florida.


- 👀 I’m interested in game development, gameplay programming, 3d rendering, and DirectX12. 
     I play games, watch cooking shows, hike, and read all sorts of books (programming, non-fiction, comics) when I'm not making games :)


- 🌱 I’m currently learning about real-time rendering, gameplay programming, and C++.
     I love to learn, and a voracious reader, so lately I've been rapidly improving on these topics!


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games, C++ projects pertaining to games, and other miscellaneous projects
     related to rendering! 


- 📫 How to reach me: Easiest way is to email me at christianorellana0097@gmail.com, I'll make sure to get back to you ;)
