- 👋 Hi, I’m @AkiraGameDev, a game developer and programmer from Orlando, Florida with 3 years of experience in the Game industry.

- 👀 I’m interested in game development, gameplay programming, tech art, and 3d rendering.
     I play cgames, watch cooking shows, hike, and read all sorts of books (programming, non-fiction, comics) when I'm not making games :)


- 🌱 I’m currently learning about real-time rendering, gameplay programming, and C++.
     I love to learn, and a voracious reader. Shoutout to tablets for being the perfect productivity tools.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games, C++ projects pertaining to games, and other miscellaneous projects
     related to rendering!
